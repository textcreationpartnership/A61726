            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>you are now come to convey mee to my death, I am willing to dye, which is a thing no more than all our Predeceſſors have done, and a debt that our Poſteritie muſt in their due time diſcharge, which ſince it can be no way avoyded, it ought the leſſe to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; for that which is common to all, ought not to be intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable to any: It is the Law of Nature, the tribute of the fleſh, a remedy from all worldly cares and troubles; and to the truly penitent, a perfect path to bleſſedneſſe. And there is but one death, though ſeverall wayes unto it: mine is not naturall, but enforced by the Law and Juſtice: it hath beene ſayd that the Lawes vex only the meaner ſort of people, but the mightie are able to withſtand them: it is not ſo with me, for to the Law I ſubmit my ſelfe, and confeſſe that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing but juſtice: for hee that politikely intendeth good to a Common-weale, may be called a juſt man, but hee that practiſeth either for his owne profit, or any other ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ends, may be well termed a delinquent perſon; neither is delay in puniſhment any privilege for pardon. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, I ingenuouſly confeſſe with <hi>Cicero,</hi> That the death of the bad is the ſafetie of the good that be alive.</p>
            <p>Let no man truſt eyther in the favour of his Prince, the friendſhip and conſanguinity of his Peeres, muchleſſe in his owne wiſdome and knowledge, of which I ingenuouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I have beene too confident. Kings, as they are men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, ſo they are Gods before men, and I may ſay with a great man once in this Kingdome, <hi>Had I ſtrived to obey my

                  <!-- PDF PAGE 96 -->God as faithfully, as I ſought to honour my King diligently, J had ſtood, and not fallen.</hi> Moſt happie and fortunate is that Prince, who is as much for his juſtice feared, as for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe beloved: For the greater that Princes are in power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other, the more they ought in vertue to excell other; and ſuch is the royall Soveraigne whom I late ſerved.</p>
            <p>For my Peeres, the correſpondence that I had with them during my proſperitie, was to mee very delightfull and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and here they have commiſerated my ruine, I have plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully found, who (for the moſt generous of them) I may boldly ſay, though they have deteſted the fact, yet they have pitied the perſon delinquent; the firſt in their loyaltie, the laſt in their charitie: ingenuouſly confeſſing, that never any ſubject, or peere of my rank, had ever that help of Counſell, that benefit of time, or a more free and legall tryall than I have had: in the like whereof, none of my preceſſors hath had ſo much favour from his prince, ſo much ſufferance from the people; in which I comprehend the underſtanding Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, not the many headed moſter, Multitude: But I have offended, am ſentenced, and muſt now ſuffer.</p>
            <p>And for my too much confidence in my ſuppoſed wiſdom and knowledge, therein have beene the moſt deceived: For hee is wiſe to himſelfe, that knowes by others faults to correct his owne offences: to be truly wiſe is to be Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to our ſelves; for it is meere folly to reveale our intimate thoughts to ſtrangers: wiſdome is the moſt precious Gem with which the mind can be adorned, and learning the moſt famous thing for which a man ought to bee eſteemed, and true wiſdome teacheth us to doe well, as to ſpeake well: in the firſt I have failed, for <hi>the wiſdome of man is fooliſhneſſe with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For knowledge, it is a thing indifferent both to good and evil, but the beſt knowledge is for a man to know himſelfe; hee that doth ſo, ſhal eſteeme of himſelfe but little, for hee conſidereth from whence he came, and wherto he muſt go, he

               <!-- PDF PAGE 97 -->regardeth not the vaine pleaſures of this life, hee exalteth God, and ſtrives to live in his feare; but he that knoweth not himſelfe, is wilful in his owne wayes, unprofitable in his life, unfortunate in his death, and ſo am I. But the reaſon why I ſought to attaine unto it, was this: I have read that he that knoweth not that which he ought to know, is a Bruit beaſt amongſt men: hee that knoweth more than hee ought to know, is a man amongſt beaſts: but hee that knoweth all that may be knowne, is a God amongſt men. To this I much aſpired, in this I much failed; <hi>Vanitie of vanities, all is but vanitie.</hi>

And ſince it is my particular lot, like <hi>Jonah,</hi> to bee caſt into the ſea, I ſhall think my life well ſpent, to appeaſe Gods wrath, and ſatisfie the peoples malice.</p>
            <p>O what is eloquence more than aire? faſhioned with an articulate and diſtinct ſound, when it is a ſpeciall vertue to ſpeake little and well, and ſilence is oft the beſt oratorie; for fooles in their dumbneſſe may be accounted wiſe: It hath power to make a good matter ſeeme bad, and a bad cauſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare good: but mine was to mee unprofitable, and like the Cypreſſe trees, which are great and tall, but altogether without fruit.</p>
            <p>What is honour? but the firſt ſtep to diſquietneſſe, and power is ſtill waited on by envie, neither hath it any privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege againſt infamie. It is held to be the chiefe part of honor, for a man to joyne to his office and calling, curteſie and affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, commiſeration and pitie: for thereby he draweth to him with a kind of compulſion, the hearts of the multitude. But that was the leaſt part of my ſtudy, which now makes me call to mind, that the greater the perſons are in authority, the ſooner they are catcht in any delinquencie, and their

But high and noble ſpirits finding themſelves wounded, grieve not ſo much at their owne paine and perplexitie, as at the deriſion and ſcofs of their enemy: but for mine owne part, though I might have many in my life, I hope to finde none in my death.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other things which pollute and contaminate the mindes of great ſpirits, there is none more heinons than Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, which is ſeldome unaccompanyed with Avarice: Such, to poſſeſſe their ends, care not to violate the Lawes of Religion, and Reaſon, and to breake the bonds of Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and equity, with the neareſt tyes of Conſanguinity, and Amity; of which as I have beene guilty, ſo I crave at Gods hands forgiveneſſe. It is a Maxime in Philoſophy, that am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious men can bee never good Counſellours to Princes; the deſire of having more is common to great Lords, and a deſire of Rule a great cauſe of their Ruine.</p>
            <p>My Lords, I am now the hopeleſſe Preſident, may I bee to you all an happy example: For Ambition devoureth gold, and drinketh bloud, and climbeth ſo high by other mens heads, that at the length in the fall it breaketh its own neck: therefore it is better to live in humble content, than in high care and trouble: For more precious is want with hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, than wealth with infamy: For what are wee but meere vapours, which in a ſerene Element aſcend high, and upon an inſtant, like Smoak, vaniſh into nothing: or like Ships without Pilots, toſt up and downe upon the Seas by contrary winds and tempeſts. But the good husbandman thinks bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of thoſe eares of Corne, which bow downe, and grow crooked, than thoſe which are ſtreight and upright, becauſe he is aſſured to finde more ſtore of graine in the one than in the other. This all men know, yet of this, how few make uſe: The defect whereof muſt be now my paine: may my ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering prove to others profit.</p>

For what hath now the favour of my Prince, the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with my Peeres, the volubility of a tongue, the ſtrength of my memory, my learning, or knowledge, my honours, or Offices, my power, and potency, my riches, and treaſure, (all theſe the eſpeciall gifts, both of Nature, and Fortune) what have all theſe profited mee? Bleſſings I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, though by God beſtowed upon man; yet not all of them together upon many: yet by the Divine providence, the moſt of them met in me: of which had I made happy uſe, I might ſtill have flouriſht, who now am forc'd immaturely to fall.</p>
            <p>I now could wiſh, (but that <hi>utinam</hi> is too late) that God with his outward goodneſſe towards mee had ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed his inward grace, that I had chuſed the <hi>medium</hi> path, neither inclining to the right hand, nor deviating to the left; but like <hi>Icarus</hi> with my waxen wings, fearing by too low a flight to moyſten them with the Waves: I ſoared too high, and too neare the Sunne, by which they being melted; I ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming at the higheſt, am precipitated to the loweſt: and am made a wretched prey to the Waters: But I who before built my houſe upon the the ſand, have now ſetled my hopes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rock my Saviour: by whoſe onely merits my ſole truſt is, that whatſoever becomes of my body, yet in this boſome my ſoule may be Sanctuaried.</p>

            <p>There can bee no greater vanity in the world, than to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme the world, which regardeth no man; and to make ſlight account of God who greatly reſpecteth all men; and there can bee no greater folly in man, than by much Travell to increaſe his goods, and pamper his body, and in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim with vaine delights and pleaſures, to loſe his ſoule. It is a great folly in any man to attempt a bad beginning, in hope of a good ending; and to make that proper to one, which was before common to all, is meere indiſcretion, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of diſcord, which I poſitively wiſh may end in this my puniſhment.</p>
